# SAF-Creaticve-Portfolio
This is a site made by me that displays my creative works! 

Though this site is not complete yet, it will feature a minimalist. modern look that will highlight my creative work in terms of my professional DP (director of Photography) career. This site uses HTML, CSS and will incorporate JS as well as I develop it further. 

The goal was to bridge the gap between my knowledge in technology and experience as a creative!
